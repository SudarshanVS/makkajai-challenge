Makkajai coding challenge question number 3 (Conference):

The problem can be solved using a modified DP knapsack algorithm.

The exposed static methods from program.driver package can be used to run the program:

1. ProgramDriver.startWithDataSet(Conference conference, ArrayList<Event> events)
Takes two arguments,
=> A conference object, from program.objects package.
=> An ArrayList of Event objects, from program.objects package. 

2. ProgramDriver.startWithDataSet(Conference conference, Event[] events)
Takes two arguments,
=> A conference object, from program.objects package.
=> An Array of Event objects, from program.objects package. 

3. ProgramDriver.startWithUserInput(Conference conference)
Takes only one argument,
=> A conference object, from program.objects package.
=> The user will be prompted to enter the event name and duration



Definitions:

Conference => An object that represents the conference data (start time, breaks, end time, etc.) 
Event => An object that represents individual talks/seminars
